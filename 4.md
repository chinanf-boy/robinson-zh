This article will begin the [layout](https://github.com/mbrubeck/robinson/blob/master/src/layout.rs) module, which takes the style tree and translates it into a bunch of rectangles in a two-dimensional space. This is a big module, so I'm going to split it into several articles. Also, some of the code I share in this article may need to change as I write the code for the later parts.

The layout module's input is the style tree from [Part 4](/mbrubeck/2014/08/23/toy-layout-engine-4-style.html), and its output is yet another tree, the _layout tree_. This takes us one step further in our mini rendering pipeline:

I'll start by talking about the basic HTML/CSS layout model. If you've ever learned to develop web pages you might be familiar with this already—but it may look a bit different from the implementer's point of view.

The Box Model
-------------

Layout is all about _boxes_. A box is a rectangular section of a web page. It has a width, a height, and a position on the page. This rectangle is called the _content area_ because it's where the box's content is drawn. The content may be text, image, video, or other boxes.

A box may also have _padding_, _borders_, and _margins_ surrounding its content area. The CSS spec has a [diagram](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#box-dimensions) showing how all these layers fit together.

Robinson stores a box's content area and surrounding areas in the following structure. \[**Rust note:** `f32` is a 32-bit floating point type.\]

    // CSS box model. All sizes are in px.
    
    struct Dimensions {
        // Position of the content area relative to the document origin:
        content: Rect,
    
        // Surrounding edges:
        padding: EdgeSizes,
        border: EdgeSizes,
        margin: EdgeSizes,
    }
    
    struct Rect {
        x: f32,
        y: f32,
        width: f32,
        height: f32,
    }
    
    struct EdgeSizes {
        left: f32,
        right: f32,
        top: f32,
        bottom: f32,
    }

Block and Inline Layout
-----------------------

**Note:** This section contains diagrams that won't make sense if you are reading them without the associated visual styles. If you are reading this in a feed reader, try opening the [original page](/mbrubeck//2014/09/08/toy-layout-engine-5-boxes.html) in a regular browser tab. I also included text descriptions for those of you using screen readers or other assistive technologies.

The CSS [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property determines which type of box an element generates. CSS defines several box types, each with its own layout rules. I'm only going to talk about two of them: _block_ and _inline_.

I'll use this bit of pseudo-HTML to illustrate the difference:

    <container>
      <a></a>
      <b></b>
      <c></c>
      <d></d>
    </container>

_Block boxes_ are placed vertically within their container, from top to bottom.

    a, b, c, d { display: block; }

**Description:** The diagram below shows four rectangles in a vertical stack.

a

b

c

d

_Inline boxes_ are placed horizontally within their container, from left to right. If they reach the right edge of the container, they will wrap around and continue on a new line below.

    a, b, c, d { display: inline; }

**Description:** The diagram below shows boxes \`a\`, \`b\`, and \`c\` in a horizontal line from left to right, and box \`d\` in the next line.

a

b

c

d

Each box must contain _only_ block children, or _only_ inline children. When an DOM element contains a mix of block and inline children, the layout engine inserts [anonymous boxes](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level) to separate the two types. (These boxes are "anonymous" because they aren't associated with nodes in the DOM tree.)

In this example, the inline boxes `b` and `c` are surrounded by an _anonymous block box_, shown in pink:

    a    { display: block; }
    b, c { display: inline; }
    d    { display: block; }

**Description:** The diagram below shows three boxes in a vertical stack. The first is labeled \`a\`; the second contains two boxes in a horizonal row labeled \`b\` and \`c\`; the third box in the stack is labeled \`d\`.

a

b

c

d

Note that content grows _vertically_ by default. That is, adding children to a container generally makes it taller, not wider. Another way to say this is that, by default, the width of a block or line depends on its container's width, while the height of a container depends on its children's heights.

This gets more complicated if you override the default values for properties like `width` and `height`, and _way_ more complicated if you want to support features like [vertical writing](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-writing-modes/).

The Layout Tree
---------------

The layout tree is a collection of boxes. A box has dimensions, and it may contain child boxes.

    struct LayoutBox<'a> {
        dimensions: Dimensions,
        box_type: BoxType<'a>,
        children: Vec<LayoutBox<'a>>,
    }

A box can be a block node, an inline node, or an anonymous block box. (This will need to change when I implement text layout, because line wrapping can cause a single inline node to split into multiple boxes. But it will do for now.)

    enum BoxType<'a> {
        BlockNode(&'a StyledNode<'a>),
        InlineNode(&'a StyledNode<'a>),
        AnonymousBlock,
    }

To build the layout tree, we need to look at the `display` property for each DOM node. I added some code to the `style` module to get the `display` value for a node. If there's no specified value it returns the initial value, `'inline'`.

    enum Display {
        Inline,
        Block,
        None,
    }
    
    impl StyledNode {
        // Return the specified value of a property if it exists, otherwise `None`.
        fn value(&self, name: &str) -> Option<Value> {
            self.specified_values.get(name).map(|v| v.clone())
        }
    
        // The value of the `display` property (defaults to inline).
        fn display(&self) -> Display {
            match self.value("display") {
                Some(Keyword(s)) => match &*s {
                    "block" => Display::Block,
                    "none" => Display::None,
                    _ => Display::Inline
                },
                _ => Display::Inline
            }
        }
    }

Now we can walk through the style tree, build a `LayoutBox` for each node, and then insert boxes for the node's children. If a node's `display` property is set to `'none'` then it is not included in the layout tree.

    // Build the tree of LayoutBoxes, but don't perform any layout calculations yet.
    fn build_layout_tree<'a>(style_node: &'a StyledNode<'a>) -> LayoutBox<'a> {
        // Create the root box.
        let mut root = LayoutBox::new(match style_node.display() {
            Block => BlockNode(style_node),
            Inline => InlineNode(style_node),
            DisplayNone => panic!("Root node has display: none.")
        });
    
        // Create the descendant boxes.
        for child in &style_node.children {
            match child.display() {
                Block => root.children.push(build_layout_tree(child)),
                Inline => root.get_inline_container().children.push(build_layout_tree(child)),
                DisplayNone => {} // Skip nodes with `display: none;`
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
    
    impl LayoutBox {
        // Constructor function
        fn new(box_type: BoxType) -> LayoutBox {
            LayoutBox {
                box_type: box_type,
                dimensions: Default::default(), // initially set all fields to 0.0
                children: Vec::new(),
            }
        }
        // ...
    }

If a block node contains an inline child, create an anonymous block box to contain it. If there are several inline children in a row, put them all in the same anonymous container.

    // Where a new inline child should go.
    fn get_inline_container(&mut self) -> &mut LayoutBox {
        match self.box_type {
            InlineNode(_) | AnonymousBlock => self,
            BlockNode(_) => {
                // If we've just generated an anonymous block box, keep using it.
                // Otherwise, create a new one.
                match self.children.last() {
                    Some(&LayoutBox { box_type: AnonymousBlock,..}) => {}
                    _ => self.children.push(LayoutBox::new(AnonymousBlock))
                }
                self.children.last_mut().unwrap()
            }
        }
    }

This is intentionally simplified in a number of ways from the standard CSS [box generation](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#box-gen) algorithm. For example, it doesn't handle the case where an inline box contains a block-level child. Also, it generates an unnecessary anonymous box if a block-level node has only inline children.

To Be Continued…
----------------

Whew, that took longer than I expected. I think I'll stop here for now, but don't worry: [Part 6](/mbrubeck/2014/09/17/toy-layout-engine-6-block.html) is coming soon, and will cover block-level layout.

Once block layout is finished, we could jump ahead to the next stage of the pipeline: painting! I think I might do that, because then we can finally see the rendering engine's output as pretty pictures instead of just numbers.

However, the pictures will just be a bunch of colored rectangles, unless we finish the layout module by implementing inline layout and text layout. If I don't implement those before moving on to painting, I hope to come back to them afterward.
